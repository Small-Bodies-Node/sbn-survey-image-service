# SBN Survey Image Service

## What is This?

The SBN Survey Image Service is a REST API that enables a user to retrieve archive images and cutouts thereof from the Planetary Data System's Small-Bodies Node (PDS SBN). For example, a user may request a full-frame image from the ATLAS survey archive, or a small cutout around their object of interest. The returned data may be in FITS, JPEG, or PNG formats. The service can also return the image's PDS label.
